# Reverse digits of an integer.
#
# Example1: x = 123, return 321
# Example2: x = -123, return -321

#
# Have you thought about this?
# Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
#
# If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
#
# Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
#
# For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
#
# Update (2014-11-10):
# Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.
