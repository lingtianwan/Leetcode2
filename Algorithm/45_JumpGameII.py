# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
#
# For example:
# Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
#
# The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
#
# Note:
# You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
